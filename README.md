# Sentiment Analysis - Eden AI API
## Description
This repositery provides code to implement Eden AI Sentiment Analysis API. Eden AI Sentiment Analysis API allows to call Sentiment Analysis APIs from multpile sentiment analysis providers. It permits to get results from these providers, compare the results, siwtch between providers or combine them.

## What is Eden AI ?
[Eden AI](https://www.edanai.co/) is a SaaS providing APIs connected to big (AWS, GCP, etc.) and small AI providers for vision, text, audio, OCR, prediction and translation AI engines. Our solution allows users to compare the performance of these providers APIs according to their data and use them directly via our API thus offering great flexibility and making it very easy to change supplier. In particular, we offer better performance with the "Genius" feature that cleverly combines results from multiple providers.
